You will create multiple network that can be communicate each other. You will also create multiple EC2 compute instance to simulate real-life scenario. There are 4 checkpoints of the lab: Creates 3 separate Virtual Private Cloud networks. Create 3 EC2 instances in each VPC. Create VPC Peering to establish connectivity between VPCs. You will validate that EC2 on different VPCs can communicate over VPC peering using ping command. Create Transit Gateway as centralised connectivity across VPCs.
